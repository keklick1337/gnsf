# GNSF ‚Äì Get New Samsung Firmware

![GNSF Logo](AppIcons/128.png)

Hey there! üëã  
Ever needed to grab the latest Samsung firmware for **Odin** and decrypt it without jumping through hoops? That‚Äôs exactly why I built **GNSF**. It‚Äôs a simple CLI tool that helps you:

- Fetch the newest firmware for your Samsung model/region  
- Download it with resume support  
- Auto-decrypt `.enc2`/`.enc4` packages  

All in one go.

1. Clone this repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/keklick1337/gnsf.git
   cd gnsf
   ```

2. Install dependencies  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

You‚Äôre all set!

## Usage

Run the main script with `-m` (model) and `-r` (region), plus one of the commands below:

```bash
python gnsf.py -m <MODEL> -r <CSC> <command> [options]
# or
./gnsf.py -m <MODEL> -r <CSC> <command> [options]
```

### 1. check

See what the latest firmware is for a specific region, or loop through all known CSC codes:

```bash
# Single region
./gnsf.py -m SM-S928B -r XSA check

# All regions (will print ‚Äúnot found‚Äù if not available)
./gnsf.py -m SM-S928B check
```

### 2. download

Download + decrypt in one shot:

```bash
./gnsf.py \
  -m SM-S928B \
  -r XSA \
  -i 12345678 \
  download \
  -O ./downloads \
  # Replace 12345678 to your IMEI
  # optionally -v to specify a version; omit for ‚Äúlatest‚Äù
  # use --resume to pick up where you left off
  # add --no-decrypt to skip the auto‚Äëdecrypt step
```

### 3. decrypt

Just decrypt a file you already downloaded:

```bash
./gnsf.py \
  -m SM-S928B \
  decrypt \
  -v FULL_VERSION_NAME_HERE \
  -V 4 \
  -i firmware.enc4 \
  -o firmware.tar.md5
```

Or make it executable and double-click in Finder:

```bash
chmod +x gnsf-GUI.py
```

#### On Linux

```bash
# Navigate to the GNSF directory
cd gnsf

# Ensure Tkinter is installed (Ubuntu/Debian example)
sudo apt-get install python3-tk

# Run the GUI
python3 gnsf-GUI.py
```

Or make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x gnsf-GUI.py
./gnsf-GUI.py
```

### GUI Features

- Easy firmware checking across multiple regions
- Download progress with speed and ETA display
- Auto-opening of download folder when complete
- All the power of the CLI with a user-friendly interface

## Handy Tips

- If you only give the first 8 digits of your IMEI with `-i`, the tool will pad & Luhn‚Äëcheck the rest for you.  
- `.enc2` files use V2 decryption, `.enc4` use V4. GNSF figures it out automatically when downloading.
